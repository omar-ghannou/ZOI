# ZOI

## Project Description: Automated Discovery and Annotation of Zones of Interest (ZOIs)

This project serves as a demo for the SIGSPATIAL 2024 conference, showcasing our approach to ZOI discovery and annotation.

The project focuses on the automated discovery and annotation of Zones of Interest (ZOIs) through a three-step process:

1. **ZOI Detection and Initial Shape Construction:** The first phase involves detecting potential ZOIs and constructing their initial shapes based on spatio-temporal data.
   
2. **Context Retrieval and Shape Refinement:** In the second phase, we retrieve contextual information from VGIs using the detected ZOIs. This information is then used to refine and accurately delineate the ZOI shapes.
   
3. **ZOI Annotation through Context Classification:** The final phase involves classifying the retrieved contextual information using NLP to provide meaningful annotations for each ZOI.

The following image demonstrates an example of a final ZOI shape along with its context.
