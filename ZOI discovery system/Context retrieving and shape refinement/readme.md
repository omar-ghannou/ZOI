## Context retrieving and shape refinement

The second phase of this system focuses on retrieving contextual information (textual metadata) from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and refining the initial shapes of the ZOIs to accurately reflect their real boundaries.

The extracted context about the ZOIs is then used as input for the third and final part of the system, which involves ZOI classification and annotation.
